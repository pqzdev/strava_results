## Key Findings

### 1. Excellent Parkrun Data ✅
**Found:** 222 parkrun activities (were marked as `is_hidden = 1`)
**Quality:** 99.1% have polylines - excellent for geolocation features
**Characteristics:**
- Average distance: 5.04km (±0.31km) - very consistent!
- 95.5% happen on **Saturdays** (212/222)
- 87.4% happen at **8am** (194/222)
- Very clear pattern for detection

**Class Balance:** 33% parkrun / 67% events - well balanced for training!

### 2. Strong Event Name Data
**Good:** 47 unique events with multiple examples each
**Challenge:** Class imbalance - City2Surf has 30 examples, many events have only 1-2
**Solution:**
- Use weighted loss functions or oversampling for rare events
- Consider grouping very rare events into "unknown" class

### 3. Excellent Polyline Coverage
**93.6% of activities have GPS polylines**
This enables strong geolocation-based features:
- Start/end coordinates
- Course shape analysis
- Distance from known event locations

## Revised ML Strategy

### Phase 1: Parkrun Binary Classifier (Immediate)
Build a binary classifier to detect parkruns - this has very strong signal!

**Training Data:** 678 total (222 parkrun, 456 non-parkrun)

**Strong Features:**
- **Distance:** Parkruns = 5.04km ±0.31km (very tight distribution!)
- **Day of week:** 95.5% on Saturday
- **Time of day:** 87.4% at 8am local time
- **Activity name:** Often contains "parkrun" but not always
- **Geolocation:** If we have known parkrun locations, distance from them

**Model:** XGBoost binary classifier
**Expected Performance:** Very high (>95% accuracy) due to clear patterns

### Phase 2: Event Name Predictor
Focus on predicting event names for the 456 non-parkrun races.

**Features:**
- Distance (strong signal - events have consistent distances)
- Date/time (some events are annual)
- Location (start coordinates from polyline)
- Activity name (text features)
- Course shape (from polyline - loop vs out-and-back)

**Model:**
- XGBoost multi-class classifier
- Handle class imbalance with sample weights
- Unknown event detection based on confidence threshold + geographic distance

**Success Metrics:**
- Top-1 accuracy (exact match)
- Top-3 accuracy (event in top 3 predictions)
- Unknown detection precision/recall

## Data Files

- **Raw Export:** `ml/data/races_raw.json` (455 records)
- **Processed CSV:** `ml/data/races_training.csv` (with engineered features)
- **Statistics:** `ml/data/data_stats.json` (summary metrics)

## Phase 2: Feature Engineering & Model Training ✅

### Feature Engineering Complete
Created comprehensive feature engineering pipeline extracting 32 features:

**Core Features:**
- `distance_km`, `pace_min_per_km`, `elevation_gain`

**Time Features:**
- `day_of_week`, `hour`, `month`
- One-hot encoded day of week (7 features)
- One-hot encoded hour bins (6 features for 6am-10am)

**Text Features from Activity Names:**
- `contains_parkrun`, `contains_marathon`, `contains_half`, `contains_ultra`, `contains_fun_run`
- `name_length`

**Distance Category Features:**
- `is_5k`, `is_10k`, `is_half_marathon`, `is_marathon`, `is_ultra`

### Parkrun Binary Classifier - TRAINED ✅

**Model:** XGBoost binary classifier
**Framework:** XGBoost 3.1.1 with scikit-learn 1.2.2

**Performance on Test Set (136 samples):**
- **Accuracy:  100.0%** 🎯
- **Precision: 100.0%**
- **Recall:    100.0%**
- **F1 Score:  100.0%**
- **ROC AUC:   100.0%**

**Confusion Matrix:**
```
                Predicted
               Not PR | Parkrun
Actual Not PR:     91 |    0
Actual Parkrun:     0 |   45
```

**Perfect Classification!** Zero false positives, zero false negatives.

**Top 3 Most Important Features:**
1. `is_5k` (40.4%) - Distance between 4.5-5.5km
2. `contains_parkrun` (30.0%) - Activity name contains "parkrun"
3. `hour` (12.3%) - Time of day

**Generalization:** Excellent (train-test gap: -0.18%)

**Model Files:**
- `ml/models/parkrun_classifier.pkl` - Trained model (pickle format)
- `ml/models/parkrun_classifier_metadata.json` - Model metadata
- `ml/models/parkrun_classifier_evaluation.txt` - Detailed evaluation report
