# Favicon Setup

## To add the Woodstock Runners logo:

1. **Download the logo:**
   - Visit https://www.woodstockrunners.org.au/
   - Right-click the logo and save it
   - Or check the page source for the logo file URL

2. **Save the logo here:**
   - Save as `favicon.png` in this folder
   - Recommended size: 512x512px or larger
   - Format: PNG with transparent background (preferred)

3. **Alternative: Use online converter**
   - If you have a different format (SVG, JPG, etc.)
   - Use https://favicon.io/ to convert to multiple sizes
   - Place the main icon as `favicon.png`

The HTML is already configured to use `/favicon.png` as the site icon.
